SilenceCut is a desktop tool that automatically removes silence from video or audio files and generates a Final Cut Pro XML timeline with only the meaningful content preserved.

It lets you:

Preview your media with embedded playback

Visually inspect kept vs cut sections on a timeline

Tune silence detection parameters (threshold, padding, minimum keep time)

Jump between cuts, scrub, and zoom the timeline like a real editor

Reopen the app and continue exactly where you left off

SilenceCut is designed for fast cleanup of recordings, voiceovers, and gameplay footage before bringing them into an editor.
